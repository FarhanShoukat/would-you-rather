# Would You Rather Project

A react app in which a user can play the “Would You Rather?” game. The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.

This aap is good example for those who are starting react. Rather than focusing heavily on HTML and CSS it covers a lot of topics like react components, controlled components, redux, actions, reducers etc.

This app is part of the projects from [React Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019).
