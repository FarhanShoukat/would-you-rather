# Would You Rather Project

A react app in which a user can play the “Would You Rather?” game. The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.

This aap is good example for those who are starting react. It covers a lot of topics like react components, controlled components, redux, actions, reducers etc.

## TL;DR

To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Directory Structure

The project is structured in a standard way a react/redux app is structured i.e. actions, reducers, components are separated in their respective directories
